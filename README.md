# Dynamical systems notes
How common is it that what we consider a steady state is in reality a magnified part of a continuous non-linear dynamical system?

## The universe

If one where to model the density of the universe through time, it might look like a negative exponential function with an positive infinite limit at $t=0$. Magnifying the image enough yields what appears to be a straight line, a steady state. This matter is of a fundamental nature in mathematics in general, creating the study of non-Euclidean geometry. For the speck of dust in the desert that the time human existence in the cosmos seems to analogize, it might even make sense to study phenomena in the absense of overarching non-linear dynamics. 

## The human factor

Our presence is truly recent, and our studying of the economy we have created even more so. 

## Stochasticity of macroeconomic variables

There is one nice thing we could discuss, central to the concept of **Brownian motion**. The movement of particles under the influence of atomic collisions is described as stochastic. The atomic and subatomic movements being too delicate to model for, the particle seems to be moving on its own. From the eye of the human observer, this movement of the particle may be swift. But from the point of view of a flock of atoms, the particle might be seen as motionless.
